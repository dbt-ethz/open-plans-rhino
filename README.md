# open-plans-rhino
Rhino3D plugin to interact with open plans

## Getting started
The [documentation](https://dbt-ethz.gitbook.io/open-plans/) is a good place to start.

## Installation
Go to [releases](https://github.com/dbt-ethz/open-plans-rhino/releases) and download the source code (.zip). Unpack this folder on your computer. In order for this to run as a command in Rhino, the script location needs to be exactly right so that Rhino knows where to look. On Windows (and Rhino 7.0), the path to a command script looks like this: 
```sh
%APPDATA%\McNeel\Rhinoceros\7.0\Plug-ins\PythonPlugIns\
```
From the unpacked zip file, drop the folder OPENPLANS (with the crazy string of numbers!) in this Rhino folder without changing the name!
